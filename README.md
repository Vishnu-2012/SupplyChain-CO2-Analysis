# SupplyChain-CO2-Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing CO₂ emissions across supply chain sectors using multiple datasets. By integrating emission factors and applying the GLEC Framework, the analysis identifies key emission hotspots and offers insights to optimize transportation and logistics for sustainability.

**Key Features**

Comprehensive CO₂ Data Integration: Combines emissions data by country and sector with freight and container transport datasets.
GHG Emission Factors Application: Uses CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O factors to compute CO₂-equivalent emissions for transport and other supply chain activities.
GLEC Framework Implementation: Incorporates Well-to-Tank (WTT) and Tank-to-Wheel (TTW) methodologies to ensure accuracy in transport-related emissions.
Insights and Visualization: Provides analysis through graphs and charts to visualize emissions by country, sector, and transport mode.

**Key Results**

Identified key emission hotspots in transport, manufacturing, and electricity sectors.
Highlighted the most CO₂-intensive transport modes and countries.
Suggested optimization strategies to reduce supply chain emissions.

**Future Scope**

Incorporate more granular datasets for specific supply chain stages.
Apply predictive analytics to forecast emissions based on future logistics scenarios.
Extend the analysis to evaluate alternative fuel usage and other sustainability metrics.
