# SupplyChain-CO2-Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing CO‚ÇÇ emissions across supply chain sectors using multiple datasets. By integrating emission factors and applying the GLEC Framework, the analysis identifies key emission hotspots and offers insights to optimize transportation and logistics for sustainability.

## Motivation

- üåç Climate concerns have made emissions tracking across supply chains a necessity.
- üì¶ Key contributors include electricity production, manufacturing, road freight, and maritime shipping.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è The goal is to derive insights that support decision-making toward sustainable logistics and procurement.

## Data Sources

- **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions by Sector** (Our World in Data)
- **Freight & Container Transport Data** (2000‚Äì2020)
- **GHG Emission Factors Dataset** (CO‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, N‚ÇÇO)
- **GLEC Framework** for standardized transport emissions mapping

 ## Methodology
 
### üîß 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Standardized country names and transport mode categories for consistency.
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure clean, reliable data.
- Merged multiple datasets ‚Äî including CO‚ÇÇ emissions, GHG emission factors, and freight/container transport data ‚Äî based on country and year (2019‚Äì2020) to build a unified dataset.

### ‚öóÔ∏è 2. Emission Factor Application
- Applied GHG emission factors (CO‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, N‚ÇÇO) to convert raw emission values into CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent (CO‚ÇÇe).
- Standardized emissions measurement using Global Warming Potential (GWP) multipliers to enable cross-comparisons between gases.

### üìä 3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- **Sector-wise analysis**: Identified top-emitting sectors such as transport, electricity & heat production, manufacturing, and bunker fuels.
- **Transport mode comparison**: Compared emissions from road, rail, maritime, and air freight using both freight and container datasets.
- **Geographical analysis**: Highlighted top CO‚ÇÇ-emitting countries and tracked regional emission trends over time.
- Used bar charts, line graphs, and stacked visuals to highlight high-impact areas.

### üîç 4. Supply Chain Impact Assessment
- Mapped emissions to major supply chain stages:
  - Sourcing & Procurement
  - Production
  - Logistics & Transportation
  - Distribution & Last-Mile Delivery
- Assessed the most emission-intensive activities and recommended:
  - Shifting freight from road to rail
  - Integrating renewable energy into electricity-heavy processes
  - Transitioning maritime shipping to cleaner fuels
